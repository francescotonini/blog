Windows Phone. It was a beautiful playground to improve my programming skills, UI and UX skills.
I got the chance to publish some apps to the Windows Store and they got a fair bit of traction.
One of them was a flight tracker using the APIs from FlighStats, while another one was a music game
where you had to guess the song from 4 options (this one used Nokia&rsquo;s APIs).<br>After the Windows Phone departure, I decided to take a break from app development and work on something
else. At the time Telegram just released their bot platform and I jumped on the train with a friend of mine,
<a href=https://contrini.it>Matteo Contrini</a>. Not only did I took a break from app development,
but also from C#, the only programming language I &ldquo;really&rdquo; knew. Matteo and I started working with node.js and within
some months we released two bots based on that framework: <a href=https://trackbot.it><b>TrackBot</b></a> and <a href=https://botfactory.it/pricetrackbot><b>PriceTrackBot</b></a>.
Soon enough both of them became very popular in Italy. While PriceTrackBot went offline some months ago, TrackBot is still
available and every day we get new users.<br>When PriceTrackBot died, I decided to go back to my roots and start working on Android apps. Because of my
previous knowledge of C#, I started building apps with Xamarin.Android. On september 2017 my first Android
app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.francescotonini.univrorari"><b>UniVR Orari</b></a>, went online on the Play Store.<br>My journey is just at the beginning. Today, my interests lie in deep learning and AI. I can&rsquo;t wait to
find my next project that, just like the others, will improve my technical skills.</p></div></main><footer id=footer><div><span>¬© 2019</span> - <span>2020</span></div><div><span>Powered by</span>
